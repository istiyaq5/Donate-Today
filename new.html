            <p id="a6p1">Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on the generosity
                of strangers to help rebuild their lives.
                Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and diaper banks, and other charities can make a

                When it comes to charitable giving, people want to know that their donations are making an impact.
                Several studies highlight this fact, as well as the mechanisms that may allow people to sense the impact
                of their giving in some contexts more than others.

                You might think about charity as something you do with the extra change you find lying around, or by
                supporting a friend running in a local race. That's how we used to feel — until we learned how much even
                a modest amount of charity can accomplish when given to the right organizations.
